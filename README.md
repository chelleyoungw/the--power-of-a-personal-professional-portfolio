# My Personal Porfolio

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a porfolio application so that future employers 
can view by deployed porfolio and seemy work samples. This is to determine if I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Usage

To navigate on the web application, you can click any of the 3 navigation topics in the top of the application upon opening. This will take the user down to the corresponding topic and describes the content for each section. You can click on any images in the section My Work. It will send you to the corresponding deployed project.
